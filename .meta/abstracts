title: Hashery
summary: Facets-bread collection of Hash-like classes.
description: 
  The Hashery is a tight collection of Hash-like classes. Included among
  its many offerings are the auto-sorting Dictionary class, the efficient
  LRUHash, the flexible OpenHash and the convenient KeyHash. Nearly every
  class is a subclass of the CRUDHash which defines a CRUD model on top of
  Ruby's standard Hash making it a snap to subclass and augment to fit any
  specific use case.
